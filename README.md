# PracticeTests
Basic, ugly app to create and use practice tests locally. Uses PySimpleGUI. Just creating this repo for myself.

Paste all questions in JSON format. checkout the tests.json file for an example. When you create a new test it'll make the change to the json so you can use your created "example" to see how that works in a json file.
